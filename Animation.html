          <h2>About us</h2>
         <p>My goal for this games design course is to have something I can call my own even if it were t be something so minimal in comparison to others just something I can say “Yeah that was me I made that it took me hours and even if people don’t realize, it was me and I'm proud of it”.</p>
<p>During the pandemic it has really opened my eyes to the fact that games are very much the future of where everything is heading especially since during the pandemic the industry took in more than the film music and tv industries combined purely because people can always play games and they are the best thing to help comfort others as a lot of games have been made with that solely in mind or even had it as an afterthought but it still has helped someone and I would very much like to be a part of that.</p>
<p>For what part of this course, I am most interested in I am honestly not too sure as I really like all aspects of gaming whether it is the hours of coding in assets or the design of characters and artwork, the whole concept is very much an amazement to me with how a game like death’s door which recently came out was made by just 2 people and it looks and feels like there should have been so many more involved but no it was just 2 passionate people that had a goal and they stuck to it and made a brilliant game that was topping charts on release.</p>
