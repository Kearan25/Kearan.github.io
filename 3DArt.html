          <h2>Creating UV Map Textures</h2>
         <p>My goal for this games design course is to have something I can call my own even if it were t be something so minimal in comparison to others just something I can say “Yeah that was me I made that it took me hours and even if people don’t realize, it was me and I'm proud of it”.</p>
<p>During the pandemic it has really opened my eyes to the fact that games are very much the future of where everything is heading especially since during the pandemic the industry took in more than the film music and tv industries combined purely because people can always play games and they are the best thing to help comfort others as a lot of games have been made with that solely in mind or even had it as an afterthought but it still has helped someone and I would very much like to be a part of that.</p>
<p>For what part of this course, I am most interested in I am honestly not too sure as I really like all aspects of gaming whether it is the hours of coding in assets or the design of characters and artwork, the whole concept is very much an amazement to me with how a game like death’s door which recently came out was made by just 2 people and it looks and feels like there should have been so many more involved but no it was just 2 passionate people that had a goal and they stuck to it and made a brilliant game that was topping charts on release.</p>

          <h2>Initial research and concepts </h2>
<p>For my game my initial idea was to have a game set in the doctor who universe. The game would revolve around the weeping angles, these are stone statues that move when not observed. </p>
<p>My initial research for the 3d models revolved around the sets they used for the tv show. The sets they used were a run-down house, a city park, and a cave. Out of these sets I decided to take the city park style approach more as it seemed more fitting. </p>
<p>Using the statue like appearance I decided to research as to where statues would be without them looking out of place, I then decided to have the game take place in a maze as most mazes tend to have a stone statue of sorts, so it seemed very fitting. </p>
<p>My current game idea takes inspiration from the Stephen king film in the tall grass where the tall grass field becomes an ever-changing maze. I have deviated from this filed area by having the age take place inside Henver castles yew maze, this is to allow the game to have a more realistic approach also having the game take place near a castle allows me to harken back to medieval folklore as to better explain the enemy. </p>
<p>The enemy has seen a change in the initial idea as originally it was supposed to be a stone angle or a figure but after much deliberation, I concluded that a stone figure wouldn’t fit in as well and would seem like the clear antagonist or obstacle of the game. So, I chose to have the enemy be able to blend in with the environment. I decided to have the enemy be a tree folk which is a tree like humanoid, they have appeared in modern media with the trading card game magic the gathering and the lord of the ring’s series. </p>
